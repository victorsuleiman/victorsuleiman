### Hi there, I'm Victor Suleiman, welcome to my GitHub!


üìã I am ISTQB-certified and currently looking for positions for Software Development in Engineering and Test, Test Engineer and QA Engineer. I currently have 4 years of experience working as a Senior QA Tester and Engineer at **Electronic Arts**, one of the biggest companies in gaming. Besides test analysis, design, implementation, execution and monitoring, I have also developed several test automation C# scripts and integrated them in our Jenkins CI pipeline, saving dozens of hours of manual testing, and saving even more time in reporting by integrating Google Apps Script to auto-format our daily automation reports.

üìö I started my higher education journey with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at UNICAMP in Brazil, a renowned university known globally, but decided to move to the CS space shortly after, coming to Canada and taking a post-baccalaureate Computer and Information Systems course at Douglas College in New Westminster, BC. In it, I have specialized in Emerging Technologies such as gaming and full-stack mobile development, and have worked for 1 semester as a Student Lab Assistant due to my teaching skills and my excellent achievement during the program, having been in the Dean's list several semesters and earning some scholarship awards in the process. 

üë®‚Äçüíª I am currently transfering my C# test automation skills into other languages like Python with Pytest and JS/TS with Playwright, in order to showcase my ability to choose test cases that have automation potential and turn test cases into automated tests, no matter the language and framework I'm using.

* **Programming languages:** C# | Java | Python | Javascript
* **Databases:** SQL | MongoDB | SQL Server 
* **Testing, Automation & Reporting:** Selenium webdriver | EA C# automation framework | Postman | Pytest | Google Apps Script | TestRail | Zephyr | QMetry 
* **Version control and CI/CD:** Git | Gitlab | GitHub | GitHub Actions | Jenkins | Jeeves | Perforce 
* **Other skills and technologies:** Unity | Agile | Waterfall | Jira/JQL | Confluence | Videogame Target Managers | REST APIs | HTML/CSS | Frostbite Debug Tools | Visual Studio 
* **Languages:** Fluently trilingual in English, French and Portuguese
