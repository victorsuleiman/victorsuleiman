### Hi there, I'm Victor Suleiman, welcome to my GitHub!

üìã I am currently looking for positions for Software Development in Engineering and Testing, Test Engineer, QA automation Engineer, and everything regarding development, testing and quality assurance. You will find my projects prior to my current job pinned here. I currently have 2+ years of experience working as a QA automation engineer, test and automation script writer and analyst at **Electronic Arts**, one of the biggest companies in gaming. I've worked with Frostbite tools and proprietary automation solutions for our FIFA/FC games, written in C#.

üìö I started my higher education journey with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at UNICAMP in Brazil, a renowned university known globally, but decided to move to the CS space shortly after, coming to Canada and taking a post-baccalaureate Computer and Information Systems course at Douglas College in New Westminster, BC. In it, I have specialized in Emerging Technologies such as gaming and full-stack mobile development, and have worked for 1 semester as a Student Lab Assistant due to my teaching skills and my excellent achievement during the program, having been in the Dean's list several semesters and earning some scholarship awards in the process.
